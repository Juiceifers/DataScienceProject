        "Questions for Australian students who are studying/studied at ETH": [],
        "For Swiss/local students, doesn't it make more sense to do the bachelor degree at a Fachhochschule (University of Applied Sciences, abbreviated FH) and then the master at ETHZ ?": [
            "> a lot of these failures come from local students for whom ETHZ is right next door, and who are therefore less motivated than international students who come from further away and are therefore more motivated to stay\n\nI'm actually not sure if there are statistics to back this up. But you definitely will find local students who didn't know what they wanted to study after Kanti and just decided to study something and then drop out sooner or later; voluntarily or not. \n\n> wouldn't it make more sense to do the bachelor degree at the FH\n\nI'll be the devil's advocat and list some of the reasons why this may not be the most straight-forward path. In order to start an FH degree, you sometimes need to have a year of (relvant) practical experience in the field. Or in other words, you need to have worked in that sector before. This is usually not the case for people coming from a Kanti. So if this is indeed a requirement, then obtaining the bachelor might effectively take one more year. Though, it's also worth to mention that some FHs offer part time degrees and other options where this practical experience is somehow woven into the bachelor's degree. \n\nWhile the degrees at ETH, UZH and e.g. ZHAW might have the same name, they usually don't teach the same thing. ETH focuses on the theoretical foundation. UZH also mostly focuses on theory but is a bit more market-oriented. And ZHAW is quite practise-focused. (And this essentially also explains why a FH bachelor might suffice to work whereas it's not the \"intended path\" with a university bachelor). \n\nThe master's degrees you mention are usually consecutive master's degrees. But there are also some specialized degrees for which admission is more competitive. And it's possible that those cannot really be reached via the FH route. Moreover, you need to get that average of a 5 in the first place - this might arguably be very feasible but it's still a thing. \n\nAnd once you're admitted to ETH, you're still not \"safe\". Passing those additional prerequisites (which are usually bachelor's courses) is not trivial. In some sense, you're going through the same filter as the ETH students did. And while one might expect that a FH BSc holder can easily pass those courses, this is often not the case. I know various students who dropped out because they were unable to pass the prerequisites.\n\nAnd after (or while) getting past the prerequisites, FH students might notice that ETH is extremely theoretical and so far away from what they did at FH that they really don't like it. \n\nSo all in all, I'd say it's questionable whether the FH path is really easier or better. However, the arguments you mention are of course very valid and especially if you do not want to go into academia, going for a FH bachelor isn't a bad choice. It does indeed give you quite a lot of flexibility and as it's very practical, it might be more enjoyable than an ETH program.",
            "People actually wanting to to a Bachelor at ETH and not FH? The curriculum is quite different and some people just like a more theoretical approach.\n\n1. You do not always need it to do on the presumably \"easier\" way\n2. It is no guaranteed that a 5.0 at a FH is easier than a 4.0 in the first year at ETH?",
            "I think the people less motivated for school are also less motivated to figure out a more complicated approach, even if it would be \"easier\" in terms of studies.\n\nAnd the people that are certain that they get through (be it right or not) are not going to risk any extra conditions like good grades, repeating similar courses, relying on some career path that might change over time or you have to explain to people later.\n\nThe only people I actually see use this is ones where the motivation changes while studying.",
            "Why make your way more complicated when you could go to the same university for 5 years? People with ETH bachelor can go directly into their masters and don't need additional credits that can be a lot like e.g. 30 ects and you need very good grades. Also you can't get into all ETH Masters with an FH bachelor degree, for example Pharmacy and Medicine are not possible.",
            "I did this. Graduated in ME, had to get a 5.0 average (on the 3 years of BSc) and I had to do a bridging year to get admitted to the Master program. I am just starting my master this semester.\n\nThe bridging year is (according to one of the professor I had that was teaching in both instution) one of the hardest year one can go through in the whole swiss educational system, and it was indeed no fucking joke. Also, the constant pressure and doubt during these 3 years of BSc on whether if I will get this 5.0 average or not was tough. As someone said, a 4.0 at ETH could be easier to get than a 5.0 at FH. An other thing, one that did his BSc in ETH has way more chances to get his master than someone who starts ETH at master level. \n\nAlso, you won't live all that \"uni lifestyle\" in FH, which I kind of regret.",
            "Wait, are u sure u gonna get admitted if you have an average of 5? Its not for sure right? So if I‚Äôm not mistaken, you don‚Äôt wanna go straight to the Eth to because you are afraid of the Basisjahr. My professor did it, he made it from an ‚Äúnoname‚Äù FH, his name Dr. Malte Schwerhoff. So it‚Äôs possible, but I think he might be an exception, which means he really perfomed exceptionally well at the FH. if you want to make the shortcut, you might perform really well during FH time, and maybe this is more difficult because you have to be consistently doing well throughout all the years? Which is more difficult an graduated with an average of 5.5 at the FH, or an average of 4 at the Eth?",
            "Two things:\n\nIf you do a BSc at ETH and go on to a MSc you are almost definitely guaranteed to graduate. I've never encountered or heard of a single person that didn't manage to get their ETH MSc degree after an ETH Bsc.\n\nIt might be easier in the beginning but doing the FH - ETH route will inevitably lead to the whole thing taking longer and the adjustment to the ETH style of teaching and studying will come at some point. Does it really matter when that happens?",
            "I actually did exactly that. Did my bachelors in engineering at an FH and then changed to ETHZ. \n\nI never planned to do it, but in the last semester of my bachelors, I realized that I would graduate with a grade somewhere in the area of 5.6-5.7 depending on my last modules. So I then informed myself what possibilities there are and found out that I could get into ETHZ for the masters. \n\nThe application process was actually very easy. I had to write a 1 page letter of conviction (not sure if it is the right translation), my CV and a document with all the modules I took in my bachelors. Also, I had to choose which specialisations I want to take in the masters so they could tell me which modules from the ETH bachelor's program I had to pass. Sidenote: A friend of mine did the same with an average grade of 5.1, so I am pretty sure this 5.0 criterium is pass/fail. They don't care how much you ecxeed it.\n\nSo then I had to do 48 ECTS from the bachelors program of ETHZ, and I had to pass them in the form of two blocks. This was a very stressful time, especially the first semester. Because I was shitting my pants from the big bad notorious ETH, I only did those two blocks in the first year of my masters. Although some of them like dynamics were pretty difficult, I didn't realize how much easier it would be to pass those in a block compared to passing each on their own. In hindsight, I should have taken some easy master's modules besides the blocks. \n\nBut I also have to say that I was kind of lucky with which modules I had to do. I had to do Analysis 3 instead of Analysis 1 or 2 for example, and those are just much more difficult. Dynamics was really the only very difficult one for me.\n\nComparing my way with the standard way, I actually didn't lose any time. After obligatory school, I did an apprenticeship in the field of my studies and also did the BM in 3 years. So I could then directly start to study at the FH. I then studied 3 years in my bachelors and had one year to do the necessary bachelor modules from ETH. The regular ETH way is 3 years High School, 3 years bachelor and most of the students also do a gap year to get some experience in the field. So I am actually studying mostly with people my age. \n\nFast forward to now, I passed all the compulsory modules of the masters last semester and it should hopefully be pretty smooth sailing from here. As I have a bachelors from an FH, I can work in an engineering office on the side and will therefore do my masters in 5 Semesters. And I also work as a TA. People from the industry tell me they like my way very much. As I worked already for three years in the field, I already knew during my studies what the things I was learning were used for later in the engineering office. Therefore they tell me it is easier for them to find fitting work for me as I already know a lot of \"how it's actually done\". \n\ntl;dr: I did it and I can recommend it.",

            "In my field of study (D-BAUG) as that much maths is just often not needed in our real life application. It absolutely builds your analytic and problem solving skills but as construction/planning is law \"heavy\" and thus is thought with local laws one isn't really planning on going abroad and thus does not need the prestigious ETH degree"
