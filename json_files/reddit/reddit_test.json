        "Choosing between MSc in RSC and MSc in EEIT at ETH": [
            "For your interests, both are good. Consider the following:\n\n- RSC is 90 credits, while EEIT is 120 credits\n- EEIT does not have a mandatory internship\n- EEIT has two semester projects (or one semester project + internship), while RSC has fixed 1 semester project + 1 internship\n- Master thesis: Maybe already check who you would like to do your thesis with, and check if they are accredited for your degree.\n- Check what courses you want to take exactly and if they are offered in the respective degree.",
            "I know that RSC offers many lectures in the directions you’re interested in. Not sure about Electrical Engineering. I’d recommend to check the Vorlesungsverzeichnis to see what degree allows you to pick the selection of courses more suited towards your interest and decide based on that. \nAlso check if any of the degrees have mandatory internships so you can take that into account when deciding.\nRegarding prestige of the degree I don’t think it matters, both are very good degrees at ETH",
            "You can take exactly same courses for EEIT and RSC, but still I would recommend RSC because they provide mandatory internship."

            "Look at glassdoor or similar websites. Usually there is not a range but a fixed salary for intern positions. You dont do an internship for the money otherwise there are better options",
            "Sure of course it’s not the goal to make money. It’s more than I heard that IBM is not paying for people doing Master thesis, and Zurich is quite expensive, so it’s also something to keep in mind, would I have to make something besides to make money or not.",
            "If you are at ETH Zurich you cannot be paid for a master's thesis, the companies cannot change that. If you have a master's degree already then the internship salary is similar to the ETH PhD salary for Computer Science.",
            "It’s for an internship, not for the master thesis. And I don’t have my master’s degree yet.",
            "If you have a bachelor's degree then the salary is around 40% lower."

            "I had this once but it wasn’t urgent (passed the block and was not about to request my diploma). At some point they removed the entire blcok and again a week or two lter I had my marks back with the change. But in total this was about 8 weeks, already well into the Semester",
            "I had this too in this block. It took 10 days after Einsicht, then I got a new mail titled „Resultatmeldung“ (like when you are initially notified that the results are out) and my grade on mystudies was updated."

        "Visa processing time": [
            "I've seen the opposite. Processing times for Non-EU study visas can be fairly quick.\n\nIs there any reason you haven't started the process now, though? Iirc, what matters are the letter of acceptance and proof of funds. The university diploma is more of an ETH requirement, and they generally give you several weeks after the start of the semester to present the physical diploma.\n\nMy recommendation would be to get the paperwork in now. Make sure you have a bank account with a bank permitted by the Canton of Zürich with sufficient proof of funds (different cantons allow different banks).\n\nAlso, if you haven't already done so, reach out to the student housing cooperatives, immediately, to begin your housing search.\n\nEdit: It looks like the university diploma depends on what the embassy in your particular country requires, and it can apparently vary. If you haven't spoken with them, it may be worth while to ask if this is an actual need, and if either a transcript or written confirmation that you will be graduating is sufficient.",
            "I am still in my bachelor's degree, 4-th course. Local embassy requires at least a proof that I've passed all the exams, and I'm working on it.\n\nFurthermore, my family will have to take a debt to provide 21000 CHF to the embassy if I send the visa application before July (That's when I'll get the results about government scholarship).\n\nMoreover, If I don't get a scholarship, I'm willing to risk taking debt and somehow working in parallel to get 21000 for the next year's permit renewal. And eventually, hoping to get a job to pay the debt of my family.\n\n  \nAnother concern is identifying a bank listed by FINMA that imposes minimal charges for depositing money from my native bank account, as none of my native banks are included in the FINMA list.",
            "Start putting out feelers for Research Assistant positions. You can usually use a work contract to offset part of the required proof of funds. This may not come through in time for your visa, but it will help for your renewal and to cover your actual living expenses, which are going to be higher than you expect.\n\nDepartments will generally start asking for CVs in June or July, but they usually only ask students enrolled in their graduate programs. You can, however, work in Departments or even Universities that are different from the one you’re enrolled in. Being proactive really helps here. It also helps that RA positions are gateways for PhD positions, which are much harder to get.\n\nAlso keep an eye on Swiss job boards. Many groups will post RA positions on them. You will not be able to start working until you’re in country, have your B permit, and a signed contract, but the sooner you start looking the better off you’ll be. ",
            "> Another concern is identifying a bank listed by FINMA that imposes minimal charges for depositing money from my native bank account, as none of my native banks are included in the FINMA list.\n\nThis is worth a separate post. Look into Wise or IBKR, assuming that Interactive Brokers operates in your country, which they likely do. Minimal currency conversion costs. \n\nThat said, I would be surprised if one of the major Swiss banks (UBS/Credit Suisse) didn’t have a branch in your country, even if they don’t advertise it. Also keep in mind that many American banks are accepted by Canton Zurich.",

        "Can't decide between MSc Degrees": [
            "Take my point of view with a grain of salt since probably you know more than me about these fields, but I would do the one in electrical engineering and machine learning without a doubt.\nYou will have a lot more job possibilities in various field (also in finance!) surely with a very high salary, so I wouldn't worry about that.\nThe only pro of the other course is that you wouldn't have to relocate and make new friends which is very tough.\nAnyways, they are both incredibly good choices, so I wouldn't worry too much.",
            "I'm with @salty on this one. Studying electrical engineering won't exclude quantitative finance. I'm sure especially with the ML part that you could go into it more quickly. Another aspect you might want to consider is that moving another place might be a good way to get you put of your comfort zone and grow a little. I think it also looks good in your resume to show that you've been to more than one place.",
            "Thank you very much for your response! It helps me to ask myself the right questions before deciding :)",
            "Thank you very much for your response! I am currently finishing my final year of bachelor’s year in exchange year at TU München, but I think you are right. It’s a good idea to add as much as variety as possible, so maybe it’s a better idea to go to Zürich instead of going back to Lausanne."

        "What to do if I cannot find a supervisor for master thesis?": [
            "This is just stupid, it is an inclusive part of your studies and you must be able to find someone without any issue.\n\nFailing a master thesis is almost unheard of, I guess some professor are too pretentious and only aim for top students pretending it is a job application, which is not.\n\nThankfully I didn't have that problem but I know many people who did. ETH needs to tell its profs to lower their ego a little bit!",
            "Hi, I had this problem last year. I was also in math msc and had an average of 4.2 lol  \nYou will not be kicked out of the program for sure. Every student writes a thesis, regardless of average.  \nWhat are you interested in? There is also the possibility of writing your thesis in a different department (I wrote mine in D-INFK on machine learning, with a supervisor from D-MATH; I did, however, do my bachelors at ETH too so my math supervisor was my bachelor thesis supervisor).\n\nFor me, the most effective method was going to professors in person, either in lectures or at academic events, and asking them directly. It took me 2 months to find my thesis, so be patient. You can also ask your TAs, who are usually PhD students, if they have any thesis opportunities in their groups. Professors are super busy and barely respond to emails so going to any office hours is the best bet. Good luck!",
            "I would send a single follow up email if you did not receive a response within 2 weeks. Professors get quite a large number of emails, and something like this would probably be lower on their priority of things to reply to. A single follow up email if you didn't get a response would be fine, just kindly word it.",
            "Of course you will find it (never heard of somebody who never managed to find an advisor ever) it’s hard for everyone. There’s just too few of them and too many students. What are you interested in exactly?",
            "Contact PhD students/postdocs in the groups directly. If they're vouching for you it will help.",
            "EPFL, here, ask for some help from some one supportive in your section. If your feeling anxious. You might be offered to put some one in CC of your mail to motivate teacher to read/answer your email.\n\nSome teacher are delusional about student capacity or interest in projects. Rejections can be really hard to deal with especially when you just end your exam and needs some confidence boost.\n\nThe school will never throw you away for not finding a master project if you are actively looking for one.\n\nIt can be hard or easy, some teacher ask very tough question about papers they published others doesn't even read your CV or grades to take some one for a thesis. It's depends.\n\nKeep in mind things are often not easy for the teacher/lab as well.",
            "Mathematics in data science and neural network. I focused on optimization, but did terrible on all optimization courses. So I don’t think I could get in any optimization groups. Now I am looking for some project in deep learning and contacting professors in Seminar for Applied Mathematics.",
            "Yeah as far as I know Bandeira rejects many. Just keep looking, you’ll fine somebody eventually. But to be fair it doesn’t sound like you are asking everybody, you have specific ideas in mind and ofc this will make things harder."
